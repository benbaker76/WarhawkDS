- Added interrupt code

v0.49 - FLASH (tied revision to SVN)
- Added code to compliment Shards with a quick bloom effect!

v0.22 - FLASH
- Added "shard" effect to alien hits that still require more shots
- Sorted a minor bug in drawsprite.s that resulted in slight y drift
- added some demo attack waves for testing
- added alien explosions
- and a few other things
- HK also has added some more sound code for alien explode and shard
- effect.

v0.21 - HK
- Changed bg2 and bg3 to be 32x32 size maps
- Rewrote scroll code for star maps
- Fixed VRAM memory usage issue

v0.20 - FLASH
- Craters and explosions now work correctly - thank god
- alien explosions are now coded
- aliens now support both linear and curved movement
- and lots of other stuff that I have forgot!! HK HELP!

v0.19 - HK
- Rewrote scroll code to scroll one line at a time
- Added NO$GBA debug routines
- Added new draw map code with routines to draw destructable tiles

V0.18 - FLASH
- Modified the sprites to include large explosions for bases
- added a nice pretty attack wave to give an idea of what can be done.
- added a little animation to the ships exhaust

V0.17 - FLASH
- Have introduced alien code.
- At the moment we have 2 pattern types, curved and trackers
- the code allows 32 on screen at once, though this can easily be increased to 64 if
- they are needed and if the DS can handle it.
- added some new defines to make moveAliens code more readable.

V0.16 - FLASH
- Detect now DETECTS!!! Hurrah... The complicated bit is puting the crater in the correct
- place in the map data????
- Changed digits in the font.png to have black surround - easier to see
- Move the code around in main for execution order as runs out of raster at end level
- error somewhere in detect code, sometimes bullet passes through
- hitting bases adds 321 to score
- sprite is killed if SpriteActive is set to 0

V0.15 - FLASH
- Debug drawDigits now accepts r11 as an X coord and displays correct number of digits
v0.14 - HK
- Text output now accepts any null terminated string, x, y position, main or sub screen

v0.13 - FLASH
- Added debug code. This can be passed a value, no digits, and position to display
- that value on the top screen.
- Added c64 digits to the font.png file.

v0.12 - HK
- Moved code into separate .s files (it's so much easier to find code now!)
- Finished dma.h

v0.11 - FLASH
- Tried adding detection to background - and failed. The game should halt on collision
- But misses some and hits invisibles? The colMap data is correct.
- Found the cause for the end effect missing 8 rasters, it was in waitNovblank (commented)
- PS - the effect causes some strange errors on a real DS - pixels at left side? They are
- not part of BG1? strange?

v0.10 - HK
- Added music and blaster sound
- Added text renderer
- Fixed sprite priority problem
- Added code to find the next free sound channel so multiple samples can play at one time
- Add 'Get Ready!' at beginning of game

V0.09 - FLASH
- Added spriteSpeed as a sprite define, this controls fire speed at the moment - only
- change variable "autoFire" to "powerUp", this now effects shots and ship speed

V0.08 - FLASH
- Added the (unfinished) sprite code into main for 128 sprites
- All sprites now must use a differnt coord system as illustrated in coords.png
- Added fire code to check for fire, and held buttons
- Added code to enable autofire upon power up
- Added bullet trigger code and bullet update code
- Moved this text out of source

V0.07 - HK
- Fixed sprite movement code (No need to wait for vblank)
- Fixed end-of-level Wobble effect in No$GBA and hardware
- Made level taller so the end is just stars
- Added score digit display
- Set sprite priority to zero so bg0 is above

V0.06 - FLASH
- Minor ammendment to BG2 & BG3, now 32x64

V0.05 - FLASH
- Added code to enable scrolling in the horizonal based on ship position.
- Added code to stop map scroll at exact end (need a bit more space at top of level)
- Added code to wrap background scrolls:-
- 	Spent 2 hours to add 2 lines (Still - you gotta laugh)
-			cmp r1,#0		
-			moveq r1,#832
- 	(turns out I had not drawn the wrap in the pngs correctly - AARGH!)
- Tidyed code
- Created InitData - We MUST reset all data at start of level (except bg map scrolls)
- Added basic wobble effect to end of level (Looks too much like snow IMHO)
- Cannot get sprites to re-plot, this must be done during Vblank apparently??
